			<p>SafeHouse Movement, Inc. started Novemeber 1, 2010. It is a federally recognized Public Charity [501 (c) (3)]. All contributions/donations are tax-deductable. Tax I.D. 80-0683200. 

   Our primary goal is to ensure that no child sleeps on the streets, and that human trafficking is eliminated. 

  Other humanitarian aid concerns are to provide: clean drinking water, food, clothing, housing, education, love, and medical care to the poor and underprivileged. 

   Our Mission is to provide a safe place for all to pray. To help those in their time of need. To comfort those who are hurting. To strengthen those who are weak. 

   SafeHouse Movement, Inc. has never used $0.01 of donated money to operational and/or overhead costs. ALL donated money has gone to the actual cause. SafeHouse has no paid employees or contractors.</p>
