		<h3> Present </h3>
		<p> <strong>Women's Shelter in Iquitios, Peru </strong><br />
  We are working in conjunction with an orphanage in Iquitios, Peru to build a women’s shelter. This facility will house women who are trying to escape the entanglement of prostitution and start a new life for themselves and their children. It will be used as an orphanage for young girls, as well as a recovery center for adult women to get off drugs, receive an education, and job training. This project still will cost about $70,000 to complete. Building has currently come to a halt due to lack of funding, but we will change all of that. 

  We are also open to local (Orlando, FL area), as well as other state-side operations. As needs and opportunities arise, we get involved where possible. </p>

  		<h3> Future </h3>
  		<p><strong>Orphanage in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil</strong><br />
  This is pretty much the project that is nearest and dearest to our hearts as an organization. We’re looking to start this operation somewhere around late 2013 or early 2014, depending on funding and paperwork. </p>
